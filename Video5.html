            <p>This documentary starts off with Zuboff, talking about how Google and Facebook are able to take all our information from us without us knowing, and is comparing this to capitalism. </p>
            <p>This is why the title of the video is called “surveillance capitalism”, it is because Facebook and google are giving out our information, and monitoring our behavior and modifying it. There is no freedom for us in this. </p>
            <p>The first book that Zuboff wrote was In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power(1988), and in that book that she wrote, she made it clear that how information technology would change the lives of people.</p>

            <p>Zubroff directly says “The age of surveillance capitalism is a titanic struggle between capital and each one of us. It is a direct intervention into free will, an assault on human autonomy.” </p>
            <p>The quote that Zubroff briefly spoke about tells us the violations to our freedom.She says this because people are able to take personal information basically straight from our faces. </p>
            <p> Zubroff gives many examples of this breach in security with Google. For example, this would be with the Google Nest. She talks about the defect with the Google Nest, as there was an issue with the Google Nest microphone and then Google coming forward as it was a failure in the tech specs.</p>

            <p>
                There are many other companies that also do this sort of thing. Such as Facebook where they are stealing data privacy when we allow Facebook to see photos and birthday and etc.
                </p>
            <p>The only way she says that we can stop this would have to be through regulation. What she means by this would have to be that the government would be able to intervene in this scenerio. </p>
