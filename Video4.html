            <p> One way to help protect you on the internet would have to be is with passwords. You should always have long passwords that are very difficult to break into. </p>
            <p> A good way to check if your password is good enough would have to be going to a specific website online to check how long it would take people to break into your account.</p>
            <p> Always remember to have 2-factor authentication as it gives your account more security.</p>

            <p>Make sure to always check what add-ons you are using, because some add-ons might take more information from you than you know of. </p>
            <p>VPNs allow you to stop getting tracked from websites and cookies. Try to avoid free VPNs and to avoid proxies as well. A VPN is a must when going to the web. </p>
            <p>For social media, try not to use real names and addresses if people are able to track you. You should not give social media access to your information, such as allowing Snapchat to access your text messages.  </p>

            <p> For pictures to try not to include pictures about yourself as people are able to track your faces as well. Main key points would have to be Activate VPN, Disable your location. Disable Bluetooth, and remove unused apps.   </p>
            <p> Try to avoid chrome as they are able to steal your information, and track all the sites that you have been too. Try to use firefox, as they are able to delete your cookies after you browse the web.   </p>
            <p> Most secure OS would have to be Windows Host OS, OS X Host OS, Linux Guest OS on Either Host, and finally Linux Host OS.   </p>
            <p> It is better to use basic phones like flip phones, because they carry so less information that it would be hard to steal information from you.   </p>
